The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) includes planning, designing, developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining software. Each stage is important for building reliable applications.

DevOps improves the SDLC by adding automation and continuous integration. This helps detect errors early and makes deployment smoother and faster.

Learning DevOps is important because most companies use these practices today. It prepares me for real industry projects and helps me become a more complete IT professional.
