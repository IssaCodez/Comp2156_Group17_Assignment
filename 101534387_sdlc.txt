In DevOps, the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is a continuous and automated process.
DevOps integrates development and operations to improve collaboration, speed, and quality throughout all SDLC stages.
By using tools for automation, CI/CD, monitoring, and feedback, DevOps helps teams deliver software faster and more reliably.
